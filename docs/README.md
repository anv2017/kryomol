# KryoMol
KryoMol is a program for visulization and analysis of Quantum Chemical computations

## Capabilities
-Select steps from optimization jobs
-Read frequency computations. Animate normal modes.
-Read TD-DFT computations. Simulate UV/VCD and IR/VCD spectra
-Fast rendering of molecular orbitals and densities
-Visualization of density differeces from TD-DFT computations
