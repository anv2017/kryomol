 EXPERIMENTALISTS THINK SILICON IS REALLY FUN TO USE
     ITS PLACE IN NOVEL COMPOUNDS IS CERTAIN TO AMUSE
 THEY SIT ALL DAY IN LABORATORIES MAKING ALL THIS SLUDGE
     "LOADED WITH THE SILICON THEY SAY", TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE FUDGE.
 FOR HAPPY THOUGH THEY BE WITH CRUD, I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE
      ABOUT THE PI BONDS ON THE EDGE AND SIGMAS IN THE MIDDLE.

 SO LETS DERIVE A WAVEFUNCTION.....6-31G*
     USE AN OPTIMAL GEOMETRY AND SEE WHERE ELECTRONS ARE.
 BUT WHAT OF CORRELATION?  ASKS THE WIRY LITTLE SKEPTIC.
     WE'LL THROW IN PERTURBATION AS AN ELECTRON ANTISEPTIC.
 AND WHEN THE PROGRAM GIVES US ANSWERS IN THEM WE CAN TRUST
     SINCE NOBODY CAN MAKE THE STUFF, WE HAVE NO CHOICE, WE MUST.

 SO THEORY GUYS HAVE GOT IT MADE, IN ROOMS FREE OF POLLUTION.
     INSTEAD OF PROBLEMS WITH THE REFLUX, THEY HAVE ONLY SOLUTIONS.
 AND WHEN THE FEDS ANNOUNCE THE LIST OF CARCINOGENIC TERRORS,
     THE THEORISTS SIT SAFELY AT THEIR TERMINALS FIXING ERRORS.
 IN OTHER WORDS, EXPERIMENTALISTS WILL LIKELY DIE OF CANCER
     FROM WORKING HARD YET FRUITLESSLY...TILL THEORY GIVES THE ANSWER.
